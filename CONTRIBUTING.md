## Tests

You can run tests simply by running `yarn test`.
This should spawn another instance of VSCode to run the end to end tests in.

The syntax tests will generate tokens for [fixtures we have](./src/tests/suite/colorize-fixtures) which are then compared to the results (adjacent folder). If there are changes and the tests fail it will generate a new result (overwriting the previous one).

When making syntax changes you should update the test suite.
